LongListSelectorAdd
===================

This repo is a sample application for my ExtendedSelector class.

The ExtendedSelector is an extension for the LongListSelector in Windows Phone 8. Next to the normal features it offers:

- SelectedItem Binding
- Option to set what happens to the list when an item is added (scroll to new item, scroll to top, default)
